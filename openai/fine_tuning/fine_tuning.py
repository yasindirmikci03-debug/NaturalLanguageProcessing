###### Fine-tuning lets you get more out of the models available through the API by providing:

# Higher quality results than prompting
# Ability to train on more examples than can fit in a prompt
# Token savings due to shorter prompts
# Lower latency requests

# At a high level, fine-tuning involves the following steps:

# Prepare and upload training data
# Train a new fine-tuned model
# Evaluate results and go back to step 1 if needed
# Use your fine-tuned mode


###### When to use fine tuning ? 

# There are many tasks at which our models may not initally appear to perform well, but results can be improved
# with the right prompts -thus fine-tuning may not be necessary

# Iterating over prompts and other tactics has a much faster feedback loop than iterating with fine-tuning,
# which requires creating datasets and running training jobs

# In cases where fine-tuning is still necessary, initial prompt engineering work is not wasted - we typically see best results 
# when using a good prompt in the fine-tuning data (or combining prompt chaining/ tool use with fine-tuning)

###### Common use cases

# Setting the style, tone, format, or other qualitative aspects
# Improving reliability at producing a desired output
# Correcting failures to follow complex prompts
# Handling many edge cases in specific ways
# Performing a new skill or task thatâ€™s hard to articulate in a prompt
